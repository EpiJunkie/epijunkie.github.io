Thanks to the partnership between GitHub and Let's Encrypt, [custom domains now support HTTPS](https://blog.github.com/2018-05-01-github-pages-custom-domains-https/).

Also, this is a bit of old new but [Let's Encrypt now supports wildcard certs](https://community.letsencrypt.org/t/acme-v2-and-wildcard-certificate-support-is-live/55579).
