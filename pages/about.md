# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}**,<br>

My spark of interest in computing started when I was 10 years old, when I was gifted a [GameCom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game.com) for Chrismas (circa mid-90s). At the time I thought I would be able to get the dial-up modem addon and start browsing the interwebs. However, we were poor and didn't have an extra phone line or dialup service. Fast forward, a few years and I started using Linux (Debian + Slackware) on retired PCs. In 2014, I went pro and started getting paid for my technical skills. It's been a crazy ride.

When I'm not tinkering on computers and my homelab, I'm out 4x4ing in my [GX](https://www.caranddriver.com/lexus/gx/specs/2017/lexus_gx_lexus-gx460_2017), doing [full pulls](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQcav-3UblQ) and road trips in my [Plaid](https://cars.usnews.com/cars-trucks/advice/tesla-model-s-plaid-profile), or ripping the back country in Utah on my [Surron](https://sur-ronusa.com/sur-ron-light-bee/).
